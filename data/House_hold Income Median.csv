2. Estimates of income from FYE 2002 onwards have been adjusted for under-coverage of top earners.
3. 2021/22 represents the financial year ending 2022, (April to March), and similarly for all other years expressed in this format. Estimates prior to FYE 1995 are measured on a calendar year basis.
4. Estimates up to and including financial year ending (FYE) 2017 are sourced from the Living Costs and Food (LCF) survey. Estimates from FYE 2018 onwards are based on the Household Finances Survey, which the LCF is part of.
